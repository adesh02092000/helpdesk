# Helpdesk MERN APP

Created a new mongoDB project, added cluster, create a users collection in the database and connected the database to the MongoDB Compass using the connection URL.

Now we'll add a new middleware

```shell
    npm i express-async-handler
```

While using mongoose it returns a promise, so to handle error we need to either use the `.catch()` or the
try catch block if we are using async-await, But if we use this express-async-handler middleware it will pass the errors to our error handler

Actually the express-async-handler, will send the error to the handle once it is thrown, therefore we still need to use the try catch block. Its just that, the error will be handled by our own custom error handler instead of the default express html webpage error

To use it just import / require it & the wrap your contoller around it

### JWT

For autherization we will pass a token each time the users registers or login, (we'll use it later in the frontend)

The jwt `sign()` take the id which has to be a part of the token a secret and a options object

Since the token contains the user id, we will use it to protect and autherize routes in the frontend
